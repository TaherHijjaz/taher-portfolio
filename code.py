        ## A Sophomore at the University of Richmond majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance and Business Analytics

        I was born in Palestine üáµüá∏, raised in Dubai for 14 years, and then immigrated to the United States four and a half years ago. I completed high school in Oklahoma, spent my freshman year at the University of Oklahoma, and then transferred to the University of Richmond ‚Äî where I‚Äôm now in my second semester.

        Outside the classroom, I'm passionate about soccer ‚öΩ ‚Äî I follow leagues and players from every corner of the world. I‚Äôm proud to contribute to the Palestinian national football team by collecting and visualizing performance data.

        Professionally, I‚Äôm keeping my doors open across finance ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs investment banking, wealth management, or quant finance. My goal is to gain experience in the U.S. for the next 5‚Äì6 years, then return to Palestine and contribute to rebuilding and growing its economy during these difficult times.

        I began my undergraduate studies at the University of Oklahoma, where I pursued rigorous courses such as Intermediate Financial Accounting and Microeconomic Theory. During my time there, I served as the Financial Controller for the Afghan Student Association, overseeing financial planning for events, collaborating cross-functionally, and forecasting budget allocations.

        However, by the end of my freshman year, I realized that remaining at the University of Oklahoma would not fully support my career aspiration of breaking into Wall Street. As a result, I transferred to the University of Richmond, an institution known for its academic rigor and emphasis on developing both technical and soft skills.

        Since transferring, I have significantly strengthened my technical foundation in finance through courses such as Corporate Finance, Investments, and Fixed Income/Derivatives. I have also enhanced my analytical abilities by taking courses in Data Analysis Software and Machine Learning. Beyond the classroom, I am actively engaged on campus as President of the Arab Student Association and as a consultant for the Lakeside Consulting Group, a student-run organization.

        Outside of academia, I serve as an Assistant Researcher for Sports Interactive, where I analyze and validate player metrics and collaborate with others to ensure accurate data for soccer clubs and players.
