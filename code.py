        I began my undergraduate studies at the University of Oklahoma, where I pursued rigorous courses such as Intermediate Financial Accounting and Microeconomic Theory. During my time there, I served as the Financial Controller for the Afghan Student Association, overseeing financial planning for events, collaborating cross-functionally, and forecasting budget allocations.

        However, by the end of my freshman year, I realized that remaining at the University of Oklahoma would not fully support my career aspiration of breaking into Wall Street. As a result, I transferred to the University of Richmond, an institution known for its academic rigor and emphasis on developing both technical and soft skills.

        Since transferring, I have significantly strengthened my technical foundation in finance through courses such as Corporate Finance, Investments, and Fixed Income/Derivatives. I have also enhanced my analytical abilities by taking courses in Data Analysis Software and Machine Learning. Beyond the classroom, I am actively engaged on campus as President of the Arab Student Association and as a consultant for the Lakeside Consulting Group, a student-run organization.

        Outside of academia, I serve as an Assistant Researcher for Sports Interactive, where I analyze and validate player metrics and collaborate with others to ensure accurate data for soccer clubs and players.

My view of work is inseparable from my identity as a Muslim and a Palestinian. I see my career not simply as a way to earn a living, but as a vehicle to serve a larger purpose. To me, work is about maximizing opportunities ‚Äî acquiring skills, building wealth, and gaining influence ‚Äî so that I can reinvest those resources in rebuilding and supporting my community back home in Palestine.

Faith and career aren't in conflict; in fact, my faith gives my career direction. Islam teaches that actions must serve humanity, uphold justice, and preserve dignity ‚Äî values that guide every career decision I make. Whether I'm conducting financial analysis or leading a student organization, I‚Äôm always asking: *Will this contribute to something bigger than myself? Will it help others?* That sense of mission pushes me to work harder and with more intentionality every day.

I don‚Äôt view my goals in finance as separate from my identity or values ‚Äî they are intertwined. I want to be the kind of professional who succeeds without compromising principles, and the kind of person who uses that success to uplift others. That‚Äôs what fulfillment looks like for me ‚Äî not just a career, but a calling.
